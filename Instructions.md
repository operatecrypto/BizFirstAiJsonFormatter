claude "I would like to create a help documentation for this. The help document should be linked from the main page. The help documentation can be added into the project as an html file on the same project


The purpose of the project is
1. Developers and users will be able to input json format and format and validate any json data. It is the common usecase.
2. Any application can their json data into this project. Means they can create a url within their application and that will take their data in json format to this utility and automatically show the json data on this page. You may also embedd the page inside your website or web page.

We are also providing an optional AI integration where the AI will convert the json data into your instructions to a natural language. 

Imagine the user clicks on a complex json financial transaction presented by a blokchain wallet and you want to absolutely sure the data you are sending to blockchain is legitimate and error proof, just by integrating, you will be able to use instructions from a third party authority you trust, and bizfirstAI and your preferred AI tool and your data, without needing any trust on BizFirstAi or anybody else in the world, you can implement a validation process.

This is more like truth validation. Your data is never sent to any server other than the servers or companies you choose.

For example, you might send the data to GeminiAI - however it will be your own gemini account that you pre configure. There are options to do fully managed integration as well"
